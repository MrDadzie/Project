# P4 - ML Embedding (Gradio) 
*In this project, an ML classifier (Random Forest Classifier from  the previous project LP3) is embedded on an app using gradio library on python. Users can interact with the application to make prediction on whether a telco customer will churn or not.

## Project Description
The project was completed in four main phases: 

* ### Setting Up Project Repository<br>
  Here, all components of the project repository was set. The main folders included ML asset and src  folders. The dataset for the ML training was also uploaded<br>

* ### Installing Dependencies <br>
   All project dependecies such as gradio, joblib and pickle were installed.

* ### Building Application<br>
  Here , the application was built using python scripts as shown in the src folder. All ML components(scaler, encoders and model) were imported to be used in the application.


* ### Deploying Application to Hugging faces
  <br> Finally, the app was deployed to hugging faces.
