## Project Description
The project was split in four main phases: 

* ### Setting Up Project Repository<br>
  Here, all components of the project repository was set. The main folders included ML asset and src  folders. The dataset for the ML training was also uploaded<br>

* ### Installing Dependencies <br>
   All project dependecies such as gradio, joblib and pickle were installed.

* ### Building Application<br>
  Here , the application was built using python scripts as shown in the src folder. All ML components(scaler, encoders and model) were imported to be used in the application.


* ### Deploying Application to Hugging faces
  <br> Finally, the app was deployed to hugging faces.
